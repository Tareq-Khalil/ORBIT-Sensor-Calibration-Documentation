# MQ-135 Gas Sensor — Calibration

## 1. Purpose
> This appendix documents the calibration procedure, raw data, calculations, software implementation, and limitations for the MQ-135 gas sensor used to monitor relative air-quality in the project.
---
This calibration provides a reproducible baseline (R₀) determination in clean air and documents how to convert raw ADC readings to normalized resistance (Rₛ/R₀).
---

## 2. Equipment & Conditions
- Sensor: *MQ-135*
- Controller: **Arduino / Raspberry Pi** (specify in your report)  
- Supply voltage: 5V 
- Environment: well-ventilated indoor area for clean-air baseline; record temperature & relative humidity during calibration
- Burn-in time: **48 hours** 
- Samples per measurement: **50–100 readings** (to average)

---

## 3. Warm-up
> The MQ-135 was powered for 48 hours prior to calibration to ensure sensor stability and repeatability of readings.

From MQ-135 typical clean-air ratio from datasheet:

\[ \frac{R_s}{R_0} \approx 3.6 \quad \text{(clean air)} \]

Therefore:

\[ R_0 = \frac{R_s}{3.6} \]

Using the example R_s ≈ 41.1 kΩ:

\[ R_0 \approx 41{,}100 / 3.6 \approx 11{,}420\ \Omega \]


---

\[ ratio = \frac{R_s}{R_0} \]

This ratio is the calibrated quantity plotted for air-quality events.

---
## 4. Solve for PPM:

\[ \text{PPM} = 10^{m \cdot \log(R_s/R_0) + c} \]

---

## 5. Validation
| Test | Condition | Avg R_s/R_0 | Comment |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 1 | Clean air | 3.6 | Baseline |
| 2 | Near kitchen smoke | 0.9 | Rapid drop indicates VOCs |
